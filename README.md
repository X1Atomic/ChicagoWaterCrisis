Since the Flint, MI water crisis, awareness of lead levels in water and other daily-use substances is dramatically increasing. As it relates to Chicago, only a few policies and studies have been done of the thousands of data points on lead levels collected within the city. With the US Environmental Protection Agency’s [Lead & Copper Rule](https://www.epa.gov/dwreginfo/lead-and-copper-rule) (LCR), testing was thoroughly underway, but questions regarding the inferences from the collected data arose, and the [LCR Revision](https://sgp.fas.org/crs/misc/R46794.pdf) (LCRR) was released to take effect in late 2024.

In September of 2022, a [Guardian article](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/sep/21/lead-contamination-chicago-tap-water-revealed) released revealing the lead levels of Chicago water, providing introductory graphics to educate the public on a seeming crisis happening in one of America’s leading metropolitan cities. Since this, we have investigated [lead testing results publicly released by the Chicago Department of Water Management](https://www.chicagowaterquality.org/DataFiles/wqContent/Results.pdf), studying how the LCRR will relate to the LCR, affect the city of Chicago, and give insight into the true lead levels of Chicago water.
